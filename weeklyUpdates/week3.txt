1.What did you do last week?
So far I decided to add to use these user interfaces for my web application: 
-Shopping list generator
-recipe database where get meals categorized by dietary preferences, allergen, restrictions. Possible search and filter option.
-user accounts.
I skteched a user flow diagram, I just need to save a digitally one to my laptop.



2. What do you plan to do next week?
I will create my landing page and a navigation bar that has labels that lead to the user interfaces listed above.  I also plan to work on the creation of the recipes. I decided to just stick to basic of html css and baseline javascript/ or a bit of react. I'm going to have to watch a crash course on react, I feel it may display my recipe page better.

3.What is blocking you from going forward?
I am stuck on moving forward currently because I am unsure what style of user interface design will help my application stand out.
